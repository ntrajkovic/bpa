            <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-black">Notes</h3>
            <p>This issue aims at facilitating exchanges of ideas between philosophers, scientists and other scholars working on the scientific quest for the origins of life, mind and the universe.</p>
            <p>To study the deep past scientifically, it is necessary to be methodologically omnivorous and to follow multiple lines of evidence. The journal issue will address:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>How methodologies and ideas across disciplines intertwined in these sciences yield valuable methodological and philosophical views,</li>
              <li>How these disciplines respond to their common challenges: a pronounced under-determination of theories based on the indirect evidence of deep history, various selection effects and biases, inherent interdisciplinarity, and crucial assimilation of techniques from multiple disciplines,</li>
              <li>How exactly the selection effects and biases are battled through the plurality of approaches and multiple strategies, and</li>
              <li>How the quest for objectivity is pursued via triangulation and confrontation of diverse perspectives rather than the imitation of the exact natural sciences and proposing neutrality to these perspectives.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-black">Invited Contributions</h3>
            <p>Invited contributions are based on some of the papers presented at the July 2021 conference “Sciences of the origin: the challenges of the selection effects and biases”.<br>

            <h2>Are there Essential Indexicals?</h2>

            <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-black">Notes</h3>
            <p>In the late 1970s John Perry and David Lewis argued forcefully that relevant indexical beliefs are of a special kind in that they are not equivalent to any beliefs expressed without indexicals. However, this received view has been re-examined of late. While Cappelen & Dever <i>(The Inessential Indexical)</i>, and others have tried to challenge this view, others have been quick in coming up with new arguments aimed to show that Perry and Lewis have a point, whether or not all of their claims are sound. Since this great debate is far from being settled, the next issue of BPA invites and welcomes submissions from both sides of the debate.</p>
            <p>The issue is dedicated exclusively to this topic, giving thereby the opporunity to a number of articles in finding a timely place under one roof.</p>

            <h2>Personal Identity</h2>

            <p>The philosophical debate about the nature of personal identity is far from being settled. The questions such as "What am I?" and "How do we persist over time?" have significant theoretical and practical implications for many fields of research. We are inviting submissions for an issue of BPA devoted to "Personal identity". The issue focuses primarily on the fundamental questions of the persistence of a person over time, but argumentative discussions of the most popular criteria of personal identity, as well as elaborated responses to the recent philosophical arguments on this subject matter are also welcome. The journal issue will address:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>What is the constitutive criterion of diachronic personal identity?</li>
              <li>The "complex" and "simple" views about the nature of personal identity</li>
              <li>The implication of mind-uploading for the problem of personal identity</li>
              <li>Personal identity and bodily death</li>
              <li>What matters in our persistence over time?</li>
              <li>Identity of consciousness</li>
              <li>The role of memory and quasi-memory in personal identity</li>
              <li>Am I a human animal?</li>
            </ul>
